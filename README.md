# Goke
Goke is a build automation tool, similar to Make, but without the Makefile clutter.

## What makes it different:

* Uses YAML to declare build configurations, instead of the Makefile syntax
* Built in Go, making it a blazing fast, multi-threaded tool
* Support for global hooks
* Intuitive environment variable declaration at any position in the configuration
* And more!

## Installation

#### Homebrew (Recommended)

```
brew tap dugajean/goke
brew install goke
```

#### GitHub releases

Download the appropriate executable for your system from the [releases page](https://github.com/dugajean/goke/releases).

## Example configuration (goke.yml)
```
global:
  environment:
    FOO: "foo"
    BAR: "$(echo 'BAR')"
    BAZ: "$(FOO)"
    LOKI: "Loki"

  events:
    before_each_run:
      - "echo 'This will run before each command in a given task'"
    after_each_run:
      - "echo 'This will run after each command in a given task'"
      - "greet-pepper"
    before_each_task:
      - "echo 'This will run once before the given task'"
    after_each_task:
      - "echo 'This will run once after the given task'"

greet-pepper:
  run:
    - "echo 'Hello Pepper'"

greet-loki:
  run:
    - "echo 'Hello ${LOKI}'"

greet-cats:
  files: [cmd/cli/*]
  run:
    - "echo 'Hello Frey'"
    - "echo 'Hello Sunny'"
    - "greet-loki"
```

## Running commands
From your project directory, you can now issue the following commands with the configuration shown above:
```
$ goke greet-cats
$ goke greet-loki
$ goke greet-pepper
```

**Available flags:**

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--init` | Creates a simple `goke.yml` file in the current directory, if one doesn't already exist |
| `--version` | Prints the current version of goke (works only with Homebrew installations) |
| `--watch` | Runs the given command in _watch_ mode, meaning it will watch the files under `files:` and rerun the command whenever they change |
| `--force` | Runs the given command regardless whether the files under `files:` have changed |
| `--no-cache` | Goke caches the given configuration to speed up execution and avoid parsing the configuration on every run. Clear the cache if you are changing your configuration |

## Tests
Goke has some unit test coverage. PRâ€™s are welcome to add more tests.

Run tests with:
```
go test ./internal
```

## Releases
Goke uses goreleaser to generate multi-platform releases.

Generate a token here: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

Add as an environment variable:
```shell
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<TOKEN GOES HERE>
```

Run goreleaser:
```
curl -sfL https://goreleaser.com/static/run | bash -s -- release
```

## Contributing
This project started a way for me to practice Go, but then I decided to turn it into a full fledged tool that can serve everyone.

I would really appreciate your contributions, either through PRâ€™s, bug reporting, feature requests, etc.

For bug reports, please specify the exact steps on how to reproduce the problem.

You decided to contribute? Holy s$%&, thanks! ðŸš€ Please run this command from the root of your fork before you write any code:

```
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/
