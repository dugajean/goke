# Goke
Goke is a build automation tool, similar to Make, but without the Makefile clutter.

## What makes it different:

* Uses YAML to declare build configurations, instead of the Makefile syntax
* Built in Go, making it a blazing fast, multi-threaded tool
* Support for global hooks
* Intuitive environment variable declaration at any position in the configuration
* And more!

## Installation

#### Homebrew (Recommended)

```
brew tap dugajean/goke
brew install goke
```

#### GitHub releases

Download the appropriate executable for your system from the [releases page](https://github.com/dugajean/goke/releases).

## Example configuration (goke.yml)
```
global:
  env:
    FOO: "foo"
    BAR: "$(echo 'BAR')"
    BAZ: "$(FOO)"
    LOKI: "Loki"

  events:
    before_each_run:
      - "echo 'This will run before each command in a given task'"
    after_each_run:
      - "echo 'This will run after each command in a given task'"
      - "greet-pepper"
    before_each_task:
      - "echo 'This will run once before the given task'"
    after_each_task:
      - "echo 'This will run once after the given task'"

greet-pepper:
  run:
    - "echo 'Hello Pepper'"

greet-loki:
  run:
    - "echo 'Hello ${LOKI}'"

greet-cats:
  files: [cmd/cli/*]
  run:
    - "echo 'Hello Frey'"
    - "echo 'Hello ${CAT}'"
    - "greet-loki"
  env:
    CAT: "Sunny"
```

## Running commands
From your project directory, you can now issue the following commands with the configuration shown above:
```
$ goke greet-cats
$ goke greet-loki
$ goke greet-pepper
```

#### `main` task

If you omit the task name and only run `goke`, it will look for a `main` task in the configuration file.

#### Available flags

```
-h --help      Show help screen
-v --version   Show version
-i --init      Creates a goke.yaml file in the current directory
-t --tasks     Outputs a list of all task names
-w --watch     Run task in watch mode
-c --no-cache  Clears the program's cache
-f --force     Runs the task even if files have not been changed
-a --args=<a>  The arguments and options to pass to the underlying commands
-q --quiet     Suppresses all output from tasks
```

## Tests
Goke has some unit test coverage. PRâ€™s are welcome to add more tests.

Run tests with:
```
go test ./internal
```

## Contributing
This project started a way for me to practice Go, but then I decided to turn it into a full fledged tool that can serve everyone.

I would really appreciate your contributions, either through PRâ€™s, bug reporting, feature requests, etc.

For bug reports, please specify the exact steps on how to reproduce the problem.

You decided to contribute? Holy s$%&, thanks! ðŸš€ Please run this command from the root of your fork before you write any code:

```
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/
